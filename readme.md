# Blockchain-based Blood Donation Registry

## Project Title
Blockchain-based Blood Donation Registry

## Project Description
The **Blockchain-based Blood Donation Registry** is a decentralized platform that enables secure and transparent registration of blood donors and recipients. It allows users to register as donors or recipients and facilitates matching based on blood type. The smart contract ensures immutability and reliability of donor and recipient data, preventing fraud and improving accessibility to critical blood resources.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized and trustworthy blood donation network that eliminates intermediaries and ensures that every donation request is fulfilled quickly and securely. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to provide transparency, security, and efficiency in the blood donation process.

## Future Scope
- Integration with medical institutions and hospitals for real-time updates on blood availability.
- Implementation of reward systems for frequent donors through token-based incentives.
- AI-powered matching for faster donor-recipient pairing.
- Multi-chain support for increased accessibility and security.
- Mobile application integration for a seamless user experience.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized & Transparent**: Ensures data integrity with no central authority.
- **Donor & Recipient Registration**: Securely stores donor and recipient details.
- **Blood Type Matching**: Matches recipients with suitable donors.
- **Immutable Records**: Ensures that donor and recipient data cannot be altered or manipulated.
- **Public Availability**: Allows public viewing of donor availability (without compromising privacy).
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Automates matching and tracking of donations through Solidity-based smart contracts.
